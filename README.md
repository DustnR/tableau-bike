# tableau-bike

I first wanted to look at where the bikes were being used the most. So I started with the start and end stations. And there is a large correlation looking at both the maps.

Next I looked at the average trip durations. And then trip times by gender. Showing that males take use the bikes more. But females spend slightly more time on the bikes. 

Also, showed a breakdown of every bikes usage in tripduration.

And made dashboards showing the comparisons.
